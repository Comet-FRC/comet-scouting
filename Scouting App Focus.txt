Scouting App Focus

OFFLINE ACCESS
	- This is the main feature we should focus on 
	- It should still be easy to submit and receive data from scouts
	- Can submit as many responses as needed, if offline then responses are added to the queue and submitted once back online
	- Alternatively, we could have it plug directly into a device used exclusively for scouting like a Raspberry Pi and then just upload the data directly

SCOUT ACCESIBILITY
	- Should be easily accessible to both mobile devices and computers
	- Easy to read as well
	- We want to make it as easy as possible to get people to scout
	- Maybe try to make it more enjoyable? Making it more interactive could do this
	- Easy
	- Being small, lightweight, and easy to install are very important otherwise people won't want to have it installed and therefore won't want to do any scouting

COMMUNICATION WITH DRIVE TEAM 
	- Must send data about teams that we will face to the drive team 
		- this is more important for us as actual scouting leads than application specifics
	- Sean should be privy to any data that we collect on any teams to allow them the best chance for future matches
		- Portable printer to print out data and physically hand it to the drive team?
	- Sean and the drive team should also be a part of the alliance selection process
		- Sean could be the one who actually does alliance selection? 
	- we could do a discord bot anyway just to share info even tho not everyone would have access
	- or not even a discord bot, maybe just a script that summarizes information into a .txt and we can just send into discord and print the .txt

DATA COLLECTED 
	- Amount of coral scored and levels that they are on
	- Amount of algae scored 
	- If possible: The amount of time taken to score coral and algae
	- Deep / Shallow Climb
	- Net scoring capability


QUESTIONS / CONCERNS 
	- Is it better to have the scouting app record actions as they happen or record everything all at once?
		- I feel like the game this year is very timing-oriented, so it's probably important to store the timing of things 
		- if a lot of people can score all coral points, keeping track of the time taken to do so becomes much more vital to keeping track of teams' data

PIT SCOUTING?
	- Should we add capability to scout teams in the pits, prior to competition? 
		- Possible fields might be Drivetrain type, Robot weight, Motor type, Vision Capabilities, Number of Motors, Drivers' experience, Autos, Scoring capabilites, intake locations
		- It would definitely help us out if we had data about the other teams

GAMEIFICATION
	- CELEBRATIONS PROGRESSION BASED ON # FORMS SUBMITTED
		- More forms = better, higher-ranked visual CELEBRATIONS
	- SCOUT POINTS SYSTEM
		- awarded Scout Points for each event reported
		- scout points calculated on main application (not sent through QR Code)
		- bet scout points on alliance you believe will win before game start (input visible before start game and after end game)
		- winner gets a giftcard
		- overall scout leaderboard (motivation through competition)
